# Database
## ERD
ERD stands for entity relanshonship diagram and is used as a flowchart to show the relanshonship between diffrent entites. These entities could be people, objects or concepts. This type of flowchart is used to design databases using diffrent shapes to distinguish between diffrent types of enteties.

## User Stories

As a user I would like to be able to look up my heroes level

As a user I would like to be able to look up my enemies level

As a user I would like to be able to look up my heroes current health

As a user I would like to be able to look up my enemies current health

As a user I would like to see how much damage my spells do

As a user I would like to see the range of my different spells

As a user I would like to see how much damage the enemy does

As a user I would like to see the name of my enemies

As a user I would like to add new enemies using a form

As a user I would like to delete data entries using a form

As a user I would like to add new heroes using a form

As a user I would like to create a report

As a user I would like to use SQL code to add new tables to the database

The code below was used to create the database.

## Data dictionary 
These are dictionaries which will help the viewer understand what type of input the table area will have, for example certain areas will have "text" next to them whereas others will have "float". This is to indecate whether there would be numbers or letters within the field of input. Data dictionaries are important as they can keep the database consistent from the start by giving it a set point as it allows viewers to look onto a clear view of what the database is going to be like and can always be referred back to when stuck.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#### Insert

INSERT INTO ENEMIES VALUES( 1, 50,'MAGE', 150,'HEALTHY' );

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

#### Create

CREATE TABLE ENEMIES( ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, LEVEL INT NOT NULL, NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, DAMAGE FLOAT NOT NULL, HP FLOAT NOT NULL );

CREATE TABLE HEROES( ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, LEVEL INT NOT NULL, NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, CLASS VARCJAR(50) NOT NULL, HP FLOAT NOT NULL );

CREATE TABLE SPELLS( ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, DAMAGEHEALING INT NOT NULL, NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, RANGE INT NOT NULL,
);

CREATE TABLE ENEMY_SKILLS( ENEMY_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, SPELL_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, LEVEL INT NOT NULL,
);

CREATE TABLE HERO_SKILLS( HERO_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, SPELL_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, LEVEL INT NOT NULL,
);

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

#### Update

UPDATE HEROES SET LEVEL = 4 WHERE ID = 1;

UPDATE HEROES SET DAMAGE = 12.4 WHERE NAME = BOI;

UPDATE SPELLS SET RAGE = 4 WHERE ID = 4;

UPDATE SPELLS SET DAMAGEHEALING = 4 WHERE NAME = FIREBALL;

#### Testing
below is a table which contains diffrent features that were tested and completed during testing. This needs to be done to make sure that the database works when it is completed.

### Technical Documentation

#### General Information

#### System Overview

This database system is designed to hold information on different characters that appear in the game. It has different tables for Heroes, Enemies and other tables relating to skills that hold all of the key values relating to that character, including Name, ID, Health and Damage. These values can be updated in real time for gameplay purposes.

#### The Role Of Database Systems Asâ€¦

Database systems can be used for a wide variety of things. The following is a list of different uses of database systems and what purpose they serve.

##### Back-end Systems
	
A Back-End Database is a database that can be accessed by different users through a third-party application rather than by application programming stored within the database itself or by manipulation of the data.
	
##### E-Commerce

In E-commerce, the main purpose of a database is to store information about the customer transactions, customer care, and inventory. By using a database,  programming a dynamic E-commerce website becomes easy as you only focus on the presentation and behavior of the website while all interactions are being managed by the system.

##### Data Mining Applications

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets using different methods. It is an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns. During the process of data mining, the database(s) are searched for key information that could uncover new patterns or sequences in the data.


#### Tools Used

The following tools were used in the design and creation of the database system:

	-  draw.io 
	Used to create the Entity Relationship Diagram

	-  Microsoft Excel
	Used to create the data dictionary and the test plan documentation

	-  Microsoft Access
	Used to create the database system

 	-  Microsoft Word
	Used to create the user and technical documentation
